    <p> When I asked my family to name a few things about me they said: father, husband, enjoys working in the yard (for some reason!), 
        banker, lots of Dad jokes, and loves fantasy football. </p>
    <p> They    
        were right, I am a father of 3 and have been with my bae for 20 years. I do find working in the yard relaxing and enjoy being outside.
      <br>  
        My day job is working in a bank for the last 13 years. I do like to have fun and life is too short to be serious all the time. 
        Much to my wife's dismay, I do love playing fantasy football (which means I have to watch the games on Thursday, Sunday and Monday)
